# gas-report-filter

This program is specifically for filtering issues in the `JUnit XML` report generated by [GoASTScanner](https://github.com/GoASTScanner/gas). The scanner only allows for whitelisting of entire rules and it is not recommended to whitelist an entire rule just for a few false positives. 

Therefore, this program will allow for more granular whitelisting by filtering out the issues that are false positives.

## How to use

### Installing

```
go get -u github.com/moexmen/gas-report-filter
```

### Usage

This program will take in the `JUnit XML` report from `stdin` and output the filtered results to `stdout`. An example is given here:

```
gas -fmt=junit-xml ./... | gas-report-filter -whitelist whitelist.json > /log/report.xml
```

A whitelist file has to be given, the format is given below.

## Whitelisting format

```json
{
  "Issues": [
    {
      "details": "<<details>>",
      "file": "<<filename>>",
      "code": "<<offending code>>",
      "reason": "This is a false positive."
    }
  ]
}
```

For `code`, copy whatever that comes after `>` in the Jenkins test result. You'll also need to make sure that these characters: `<, >, &, ' and "` are escaped.
